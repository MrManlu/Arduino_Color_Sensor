# Arduino_Color_Sensor
First version of an arduino-based color sensor/dectector.
Attach an LDR to A0 pin, and the RGB led as code shows (I will explain it better, I promise).
First, it will try all diodes inside an RGB led. After that, proceeds to detect the color. At last, it will try to imite the color detected by the LDR.
